Hey Brad -- good morning sir! I literally was just about to message this group chat with an update from my end. Since this is my first task involving our LSTM model implementations -- and model deep-dive in general -- I've been taking a bit more time to dive into how things are structured across PCM and torch-models. I want to make sure I'm not just gathering links, but also truly understanding differences and what might be worth consolidating. I'm genuinely interested in how these models are built and reused.
 
That said I completely understand if there's a target timeline you'd like me to keep in mind -- the sprint deadline is the 28th so I'm shooting to have it completed by then, but happy to adjust accordingly
