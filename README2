Epic 1: Build & Package Modernization
Objective: Transform the automation toolset into a single, version-controlled deployable artifact.

User Story 1.1: Containerize the automation toolset using Docker to ensure environment consistency across local and server deployments.

User Story 1.2: Implement a semantic versioning schema that is automatically injected into the build metadata and the user interface.

User Story 1.3: Configure a CI/CD pipeline that triggers on main-branch merges to automate the creation of the production-ready artifact.

Epic 2: Automated Server Deployment
Objective: Meet the requirement for an unattended deployment that completes in under 15 minutes with a rapid boot-up.

User Story 2.1: Develop configuration management scripts (e.g., Ansible or Terraform) to provision the server and install all necessary dependencies without manual intervention.

User Story 2.2: Optimize the application startup sequence to ensure the UI and API endpoints reach a "Ready" state within 30 seconds of server initialization.

User Story 2.3: Establish a health check endpoint to provide real-time verification of the tool's operational status post-deployment.

Epic 3: Unified Reporting Module
Objective: Consolidate the export-report functionality to generate multi-format, metadata-rich artifacts.

User Story 3.1: Update the report engine to generate a unified PDF that summarizes high-level Pass/Fail metrics.

User Story 3.2: Enable on-demand CSV exports of raw data to support secondary analysis and data processing.

User Story 3.3: Integrate mandatory metadata into all exported reports, specifically the version tag and the precise execution timestamp.

Epic 4: Centralized Logging & Observability
Objective: Ensure all system logs are persistent, searchable, and structured.

User Story 4.1: Redirect all application logs to a designated persistent storage path on the server to prevent data loss during reboots.

User Story 4.2: Implement a log indexing or search utility to allow for efficient querying by timestamp, severity level, or error code.
